# C-Piscine-42-Feb2020

This is the sum up of all the works I did during the C Piscine of February 2020 at School 42 in Paris.
This work is published under the terms of the **[42 Unlicense](https://github.com/gcamerli/42unlicense)**, slightly edited to fit the case of Piscine works.

## __PISCINEUX.SES KEEP OUT. YOU'RE CURRENTLY SITTING IN A CHEAT-FREE ZONE. PLAY ALONG OR BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN TO YOU AND/OR YOUR KARMA. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.__

* All of the modules code provided here has been proven to be 100% Moulinette-proof (cf. Moulinette results included in every Module subfolder README.md) except C02/ex12 which I didn't have time to take a look into in detail. All modules from Shell00 up to C09 plus the C11 module have been completed. C10 is still only very partially done and none of the exercises made have been submitted, and both C12 and C13 haven't been worked on at all.

* BSQ is 100% functionnal and passes all the tests provided by our friends from School 19 and available [here](https://github.com/YuuK10/BSQ-tests) but was savagely rejected for a stupid norm error that we overlooked under the pressure of the deadline.

* Rush00 works almost perfectly and was realised with bonuses but because of a stupid compination of using signed ints starting from 1 and *erior-or-equal logical operators, the program is stuck in an infinite loop when int-max is provided as one of the arguments. Easy to correct though.

* Rush01 has a perfectly working logic and should theoretically work but lack of time prevented us to debug it fully so it's provided in a non-working state. It's the only thing you'll find here that doesn't work as intended at all.

* Rush02 suffers from a few memory leaks issues in some functions and has another issue with handling multiple spaces before the ":" in dictionnary lines, but it works like a charm. Note that our file management is quirky and gross-looking but it works. It is provided with extra dictionnaries and an equally dirty but functionnal read-from-stdin method.

PDFs of subjects and other documents that weren't written by me are the property of the pedagogical department of the 42 Network (I guess) and/or any of their respective owners but have been nevertheless provided for convenience. Feel free to e-mail me if you want them down.
